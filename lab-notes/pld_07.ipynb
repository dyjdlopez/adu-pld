The condition is like a logical condition in the `if` statement where it determines the truth value. Whenever the `while` condition is true it will always execute the process or its code block. The code block or process could be any routine or code. You can assign variables, do arithetic, or even run functions. The final part is the loop counter. The loop counter either increments or decrements your control value before you feed it back to your `while` condition."
