Since the development of Python is contributed by anyone from beginners to experts, it has a great community that make a collection manuals and use cases called **documentation** wherein you can get to understand about how the code works and how you can make your code better.

Types such as the Sequence Types will be further discussed in our **Collections** notebook. Just take note that there are no definite data types in Python since they are evolving through time and as technology progresses. Some types could be as generic as `int` but there are specific data types link `Tensors` and `DataFrames` that are mostly used in a specific application of Python only."
